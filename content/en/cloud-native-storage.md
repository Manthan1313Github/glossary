Cloud native storage is a specialized storage technology tailored to meet the demands of cloud native environments.
It offers data storage solutions optimized for containerized applications running on platforms like
[Kubernetes](/kubernetes/) or other cloud-native infrastructures. A cloud native storage platform primarily caters
to [stateful applications](/stateful-apps/), which rely on persistent data storage. 

## Problem it addresses

Traditional storage solutions often face challenges such as limited scalability, operational complexity,
performance bottlenecks, inefficient resource utilization, and integration difficulties. These issues arise from
the cumbersome process of expanding storage capacity, the manual management of complex infrastructure, and the inability
to efficiently handle high-speed data transactions. Moreover, legacy systems often lead to wasted resources and struggle
to integrate with modern application architectures, resulting in fragmented and inefficient data management.

## How it helps

Cloud native storage addresses these challenges by providing elastic [scalability](/scalability/), simplified management, high performance,
cost efficiency, and seamless integration. It automatically adjusts capacity based on demand, reducing the need for manual
intervention and minimizing operational overhead. With advanced caching and distributed architectures, it ensures fast data
access and performance. The pay-as-you-go model optimizes resource utilization, and its design supports easy integration with
modern applications, fostering a unified and efficient approach to data management.

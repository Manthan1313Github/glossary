Cloud native storage is a specialized storage technology tailored to meet the demands of cloud native environments.
It offers data storage solutions optimized for containerized applications running on platforms like
[Kubernetes](/kubernetes/) or other cloud-native infrastructures. A cloud native storage platform primarily caters
to stateful applications, which rely on persistent data storage. There are a number of different cloud-native storage
solutions available, including object storage, block storage, and file storage.

## Problem it addresses

[Cloud-native applications](/cloud-native-apps/) are commonly built using microservices, small independent units of code
enabling individual scaling and deployment. While this approach grants flexibility and [scalability](/scalability/), it
poses unique storage challenges.

Unlike traditional systems designed for [monolithic applications](/monolithic-apps/), cloud-native storage offers
adaptability and scalability. Stateless by design, it doesn't store persistent data, ensuring improved performance
compared to disk-based systems. [Distributed](/distributed-systems/) across multiple servers, it enhances resilience and
performance. Traditional storage systems are unsuitable for cloud-native applications due to their inflexibility,
management complexities, and high latency.

## How it helps

Cloud native storage offers flexible, scalable, and high-performing storage solutions that align with
[containerized](/containerization/) environments. It efficiently manages data, replication, protection, and
persistence while promoting improved scalability, resilience, and performance. By seamlessly integrating with
[microservices-based architectures](/microservices-architecture/), it enables independent scaling and deployment
of storage resources.
